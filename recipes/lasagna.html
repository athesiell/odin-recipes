    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is filling, relatively easy to assemble and make, highly adaptable and keeps well, making it the best choice for <strong>home cooks.</strong></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>half pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups low-fat milk</li>
        <li>pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 package no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 package shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Place sausage in a skillet over medium heat and cook until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>To make béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and whisk in flour. Cook until light and foamy, about 2 minutes, whisking constantly; whisk in milk, a little at a time. Whisk in salt and nutmeg. Bring sauce to a bare simmer, whisking constantly until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat egg in a medium bowl; stir in ricotta cheese and parsley until thoroughly combined. Set aside.</li>
    <li>To assemble lasagna, pour about 1 1/2 cups marinara sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. 
        Top sauce with 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping if necessary. Layer 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, followed by 1/3 of the sausage, 1/3 cup mushrooms, 1/4 of the béchamel sauce, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/8 cup Parmesan cheese, and 1 more cup marinara sauce over noodles. Repeat the layers twice more, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with remaining marinara sauce, béchamel sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. 
        Cover the dish with foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and noodles are tender, about 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake until the top cheese layer is browned, about 5 more minutes. 
        Allow lasagna to stand for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
